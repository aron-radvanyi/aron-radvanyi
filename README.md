## Hi there 👋 🤝🤙

Programming often challenges me with huge obstacles similar to when I am out surfing on the rough ocean. Often, facing complex errors or problems in the application feels like a huge wave right in front of me. However, I brace up to my waves. I try and fall as much as it is necessary and eventually, I always figure out how to ride them.  🏄‍♂️🌊🏖️🤙

I am open to Junior Software Developer roles in Budapest or remotely. 🌐💻
